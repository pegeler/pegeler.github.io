I'm so excited to be back in beautiful Denver, Colorado! This has been an excellent first-time experience attending SAS Global Forum. I am surrounded by so many smart people doing really cool things with SAS. I am looking forward to coming to SUGI conferences for years to come and becoming more involved through volunteering opportunities such as the Code Doctor program!

Tomorrow at noon, Spectrum Health Research's very own Biostats interns will give their talk on [Taking a Dive into ODS HTML5](http://www.sasgfsessioncatalog.com/#/speaker/name@Egeler%20Paul%3E0@3314). This is the culmination of a lot of research and hard work. Great job, guys! 
 
If you are at the conference, I encourage you to come check it out!
