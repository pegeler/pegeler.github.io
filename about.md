## About this blog
This blog (pronounced *blŏg*, *blôg*, or sometimes [*blăg*](https://xkcd.com/148/)) is landing page where I can put down my thoughts regarding science, statistics, mathematics, programming, life, and the intersection of any arbitrary subset thereof.

Expect to see a lot of write-ups about software projects I'm working on as well as links to talks, presentations, and publications that I may have had a hand in.
